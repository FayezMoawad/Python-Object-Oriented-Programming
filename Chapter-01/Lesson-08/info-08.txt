Lesson 8: Polymorphism in Python OOP
Concept: Understanding Polymorphism and How to Implement It

Polymorphism in OOP refers to the ability of different classes to be treated as instances 
of the same class through a shared interface. It allows the same method name to be used 
in different classes with different implementations, which makes code more flexible 
and easier to maintain.

Key Concepts:
Method Overriding: When a child class redefines a method from the parent class 
with a new implementation.
Method Overloading: Python does not support traditional method overloading directly 
(multiple methods with the same name but different parameters). However, you can achieve 
similar behavior using default arguments or variable-length arguments.
Polymorphic Behavior: Using the same method or interface to handle objects of different types.

Benefits of Polymorphism:

Flexibility: Write code that works on the superclass level but operates correctly 
for all subclasses.
Maintainability: Extending functionality is easier since you can add new classes that 
conform to the same interface.
Reusability: General methods that call polymorphic methods can work with any subclass.
Polymorphism makes your code more flexible by allowing you to use a consistent 
interface across different classes. This helps build more generic and scalable code 
that can handle new types of objects with ease.
