Lesson 2: Understanding __init__ and self
Concept: The Constructor Method __init__ and the Use of self 

In Python, the __init__ method is a special method that is automatically called 
when an object is created from a class. It is often referred to as the constructor 
because it constructs the object by initializing its attributes. 
The self keyword is used to represent the instance of the class and allows you 
to access its attributes and methods.

Key Concepts:
__init__ Method:
It sets up the initial state of an object.
It is the first method that runs when an object is instantiated.
self Keyword:
Refers to the current instance of the class.
Used to access class attributes and methods from within the class.
The __init__ method and self allow you to initialize and control the state of an object. 
This flexibility is useful when you need to create multiple objects with unique properties 
but the same behavior.
