Lesson 3: Creating Methods in a Class
Concept: Defining and Using Methods in a Class

In Python OOP, methods are functions defined within a class that describe the behaviors 
or actions an object can perform. They make objects interactive and capable of performing 
tasks that reflect their real-world counterparts.

Key Concepts:
Methods:
Defined using the def keyword.
Always take self as the first parameter to access the instance attributes and other methods.
Types of Methods:
Instance Methods: The most common type, they operate on the instance of the class.
Special Methods: Like __init__, these are built-in methods with special purposes 
(e.g., __str__, __repr__).

Methods bring objects to life by allowing them to perform actions. 
You can use methods to create functionality that works on or returns data from 
an object's attributes, making your code more interactive and realistic.
