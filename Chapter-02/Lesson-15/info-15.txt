Lesson 15: Implementing Interfaces with Python OOP
Concept: Understanding and Using Interfaces in Python

Interfaces are used to define a set of methods that a class must implement without 
providing their implementation. Python does not have built-in support for interfaces 
like some other languages (e.g., Java), but we can use abstract base classes (ABCs) 
to achieve a similar effect.

Key Concepts:
Interface Concept:
Defines a set of methods that must be implemented by any class that inherits from it.
Ensures consistency across different classes that share the same behavior.
Using Abstract Base Classes (ABCs):
Pythonâ€™s abc module allows you to create abstract base classes.
Abstract methods defined in ABCs must be implemented by the subclasses.

Benefits of Using Interfaces:
Consistency: Enforces a contract for subclasses, ensuring that all subclasses implement 
the same set of methods.
Flexibility: Different classes can implement the same interface in their own way.
Extensibility: Makes it easier to add new classes that adhere to the same structure 
without changing existing code.
Using interfaces or abstract base classes helps enforce consistent behavior across 
classes and improves code maintainability. This is especially useful in large projects 
where different types of objects need to share a common set of methods.
